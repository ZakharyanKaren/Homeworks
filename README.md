# Homeworks
Hi! I study JavaScript in Armenian Code Academy(ACA), and now learning usage of git commands and push my homeworks to github repository.
I will write here more info about me, my lessons and about programming later, when i will understand more and will have time for this :)
Have a nice day! :)
